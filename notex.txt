installing express , dotenv and mongodb
// creating server .js
type module to use import export syntax
now making the database through monfo db -> create project -> create cluster -> copy password -> copy the string 
in mongodb under network acess allow from anywhere
if one want to see the connection string in the .env file then we have to import the dotenv file and then config it
then make a folder named config , under it make a file db.js to connect the databse
make schema under the model folder {convention -> name of the file is always starts with capital }
we will then make model 

////// very important  -> when we want to make something then we will use post method
